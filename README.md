# Vietnamese Essay Categorizer
An educational tool for young students that helps with writing essays
## Description
### Overview
At primary levels of education in Vietnam, students are introduced to 5 categories of essays:
- Argumentative - Nghị luận
- Expressive - Biểu cảm
- Descriptive - Miêu tả
- Narrative - Tự sự
- Expository - Thuyết minh
New students usually find it hard to write the required category (E.g. Students describe too much in an expressive essay).
This AI assistant includes a Fine-tuned SequenceClassificationPhoBERT model for classifying categories of input essay and a self written SpellCorrect algorithm for spell-checking and alternative-suggesting.
